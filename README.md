# PulseCheck 🩺

**"Stop guessing why your users leave."**

PulseCheck is a lightweight feedback tool designed for small business owners who need to understand user friction without the complexity of heavy analytics suites.

## 🚀 The Product Goal
Most small businesses lose potential customers because they don't know where users are getting frustrated. PulseCheck aims to solve this by capturing "micro-feedback" at the exact moment of friction.

## 🏗️ Project Roadmap
This project is being built in phases to demonstrate a **Product Engineering** workflow:

- [x] **Phase 1: Problem Identification** - Designing a landing page that speaks to user "pain points."
- [ ] **Phase 2: The Feedback Widget** - A vanilla JavaScript micro-interaction for capturing user sentiment.
- [ ] **Phase 3: Data Visualization** - A simple dashboard to show "Confusion Trends."

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Constraints
- **HTML5/CSS3:** Using CSS Grid and Flexbox for a responsive, "mobile-first" experience.
- **Glassmorphism UI:** Modern aesthetic to build user trust.
